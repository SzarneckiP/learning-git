        <h1>AC/DC - Thunderstruck</h1>>
        <p>
            I was caught In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder) 
            And looked around And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder) 
            My mind raced And I thought "what could I do?" (Thunder) 
            And I knew There was no help, no help from you (Thunder) 
        <p>
            Sound of the drums 
            Beatin' in my heart 
            The thunder of guns 
            Tore me apart
        </p> 
        <p>You've been Thunderstruck</p>
        <p>
            Rode down the highway 
            Broke the limit, we hit the town 
            Went through to the Texas, yeah Texas
            And we had some fun 
            We met some girls 
            Some dancers who gave a good time 
            Broke all the rules, played all the fools 
            Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
        </p> 
        <p>
            And I was shakin' at the knees 
            Could I come again, please? 
            Yeah, the ladies were too kind
        </p> 
        <p>
            You've been Thunderstruck,thunderstruck
            Yeah yeah yeah, thunderstruck
            Oh, thunderstruck, yeah
