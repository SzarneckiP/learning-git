            <h2 class="second-title">by AC/DC</h2>
            <p>
                I was caught In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)<br>
                And looked around And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)<br>
                My mind raced And I thought "what could I do?" (Thunder)<br>
                And I knew There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)<br>
            <p>
                Sound of the drums<br>
                Beatin' in my heart<br>
                The thunder of guns<br> 
                Tore me apart<br>
            </p> 
            <p>You've been Thunderstruck</p>
            <p>
                Rode down the highway<br> 
                Broke the limit, we hit the town<br> 
                Went through to the Texas, yeah Texas<br>
                And we had some fun<br> 
                We met some girls<br> 
                Some dancers who gave a good time<br> 
                Broke all the rules, played all the fools<br> 
                Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds<br>
            </p> 
            <p>
                And I was shakin' at the knees<br> 
                Could I come again, please?<br> 
                Yeah, the ladies were too kind<br>
            </p>
